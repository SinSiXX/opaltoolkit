<h1>Python Opal Web Service Client: Version 1.9alpha</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This distribution contains the WSDL for the alpha Opal Web service, and
a sample Python client that invokes a <a
href="http://pdb2pqr.sourceforge.net/">PDB2PQR</a> service that has been
deployed via Opal. Before proceeding with the client installation, please
read the documentation for the Opal Web service implementation, and deploy
the PDB2PQR service via Opal.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>The Python client should work on both Unix and Windows platforms as long
as you have the following packages installed.

<ul>
   <li>Python 2.3 or higher: Download and install Python from <a
   href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a>, if you don't
   have a Python installation on your local machine. Add the Python bin
   directory to your environment variable PATH.</li>
   
   <br>
   <li>PyXML 0.8.3 or higher: PyXML is a set of libraries for processing
   XML in Python. Download PyXML from <a
   href="http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/">http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/</a>.
   If you are downloading the Windows installer, make sure that you are
   choosing the appropriate version for your Python installation. If you
   are installing on a Unix platform, change to the extracted PyXML
   directory using a sudo or root shell, and execute the following
   commands:
   <font color="green">
   <pre>
       python setup.py build
       python setup.py install
   </pre>
   </font>

   <li>ZSI 1.7: ZSI is a SOAP and Web services toolkit for
   Python. Download ZSI from <a
   href="http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/">http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/</a>.
   If you are installing on a Unix platform, you would need to use a sudo
   or root shell. Change to the ZSI-1.7/ directory that is extracted from
   the tarball, and execute the following command:
   <font color="green">
   <pre>
       python setup.py install
   </pre>
   </font>

   <p>Note the location where the ZSI package is installed. In particular,
   note the location of the <i>wsdl2py.py</i> script that we need to use in
   the future. Typically, the packages are installed inside the Python
   installation. On Windows, wsdl2py.py typically resides inside
   $PYTHON_HOME/scripts, where PYTHON_HOME represents the location of the
   Python installation. On Unix, it is usually inside $PYTHON_HOME/bin. 

   <p><i>Opal will not work with a higher version of ZSI. Please ensure
   that you are using ZSI version 1.7.</i>.
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<!-- <p>1. Download the source distribution for installation from <a -->
<!-- href="http://opaltoolkit.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/opaltoolkit/trunk/opal/opal-py/">SVN</a>, -->
<!-- if you don't have the appropriate version already. -->

<p>1. Expand the tarball that you have downloaded using the GNU tar utility,
as follows:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    tar zxvf opal-py-1.9alpha.tar.gz
</pre>
</font>

<p>This should create a new directory called opal-py-1.9alpha/ where all
the sources are expanded. Henceforth, we will call this directory
<i>OPAL_PY_HOME</i>.

<p>2. Generate the stubs from the WSDL file with the following command inside
the $OPAL_PY_HOME directory:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    python &lt;prefix_to_wsdl2py&gt;/wsdl2py.py -f wsdl/opal.wsdl
</pre>
</font>

<p>Replace <i>prefix_to_wsdl2py</i> with the location of wsdl2py.py on your
local installation. This generates two files - AppService_services.py and
AppService_services_types.py. The former contains the stubs required to
communicate with the remote Web service, while the latter contains the
types defined in the WSDL for the service.

<h2>Running the Client</h2>

<p>A sample Opal client can be seen in Pdb2pqrClient.py. It shows how to
retrieve a reference to a remote Web service port, set parameters, and
invoke remote operations. To launch the remote PDB2PQR service, the argument
string (<tt>--ff=amber sample.pdb sample.pqr</tt>) and the list of
input files (<tt>etc/sample.pdb</tt>) are sent over. The service returns a
<tt>jobID</tt> that is used later to query for status and retrieve
locations of the output files. Alternatively, the service can also be
invoked in a <em>blocking</em> fashion, where the client blocks until the
remote execution is complete, and the outputs are returned as a response to
the same invocation.

<p>To run the client, you can run the following command from inside the
$OPAL_PY_HOME directory.
<font color="green">
<pre>
    python Pdb2pqrClient.py
</pre>
</font>

<p>By default, the client uses the Web service running on
http://localhost:8080. To change this location, modify the URL inside
Pdb2pqrClient.py.

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>The Opal Web service can be optionally set up to accept connections
using GSI-based HTTPS (refer to the <a
href="http://nbcr.net/services/opal/security.html">security</a>
documentation for instructions). The following snippet of code from
Pdb2pqrClient.py shows how to access a secure Opal service from Python.
<font color="green">
<pre>
# set the locations for the X509 certificate and key
cert = "/Users/sriramkrishnan/certs/apbs_service.cert.pem"
key = "/Users/sriramkrishnan/certs/apbs_service.privkey"
...
	# example of ssl invocation
	appServicePort = appLocator.getAppServicePortType(
	    baseURL + "opal/services/Pdb2pqrServicePort",
	    ssl=1,
	    cert_file=cert,
	    key_file=key,
	    transport=httplib.HTTPSConnection)
...
</pre>
</font>

<p>Note that if you are using proxy certificates, they have to be RFC 3820
compliant. This can be done by creating a Grid proxy using
<tt>grid-proxy-init -rfc</tt> (only works for Globus Toolkit 4.0.x). This
has only been tested with OpenSSL version 0.9.7g, and may not work with
older versions.
