<h1>Opal: The Application Wrapper Web Service (Version 1.5.1)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Opal, the Application Wrapper Web service, provides a way to wrap up
existing scientific applications rapidly as Web services, and expose them
to various clients. The implementation provides features such as scheduling
(e.g. using Condor/SGE via Globus or DRMAA) and security (using GSI-based
certificates), Furthermore, the service provides job and data management
(by executing every job in a separate working directory), and state
management (by storing the service state in a PostgreSQL database). The
application developer specifies a configuration for a scientific
application and deploys the application as a service following a small
sequence of steps. End-users can now access this application remotely using
the WSDL of the service.

<p>The WSDL for the service is defined inside <i>wsdl/opal.wsdl</i>. Stub
generators provided by Web service toolkits are then used to generate the
client and server-side bindings for the services. In our case, the services
are implemented in Java using the Apache Axis toolkit, while the clients
can be in any language.

<p>The WSDL defines operations to do the following:
<ol>
   <li>Get application metadata (<tt>getAppMetadata</tt>): This returns
   metadata about the application. This includes usage information, along
   with any number of arbitrary application-specific metadata specified as
   an array of <tt>info</tt> elements, e.g. description of the various
   options that are passed to the application binary. Ideally, these
   elements should be arbitrary XML's (specified by <tt>xsd:any</tt> tags).
   However, due to the limitations of certains toolkits in other languages
   (e.g. ZSI in Python), we specify them as Strings for now. You may embed
   XML tags inside them using CDATA sections.</li>

   <li>Launch job (<tt>launchJob</tt>): This operation requires the list of
   arguments as a string, and an array of structures representing the input
   files. The structure contains the <i>name</i> of the input file and the
   <i>contents</i> in Base64 encoded binary form. The operation returns a
   Job ID that can be used to retrieve job status and outputs.</li>

   <li>Query job status (<tt>queryStatus</tt>): This operation expects a
   Job ID to query the status of a running job. A status code, message, and
   URL of the working directory for the job are returned.</li>

   <li>Get job outputs (<tt>getOutputs</tt>): This operation returns the
   outputs from a job that is identified by a Job ID. The output consists
   of the urls for the standard output and error, and an array of
   structures representing the output files. The structure contains the
   <i>name</i> of the output file and the <i>url</i> from where it can be
   downloaded.</li>

   <li>Get output file by name (<tt>getOutputAsBase64ByName</tt>): This
   operation returns the contents of an output file as Base64 binary. The
   input is a data structure that contains the Job ID for a particular job,
   and the name of the file to be retrieved.</li>

   <li>Destroy job (<tt>destroy</tt>): This operation destroys a running
   job identified by a Job ID.</li>

   <li>Launch blocking job (<tt>launchJobBlocking</tt>): This operation
   requires the list of arguments as a string, and an array of structures
   representing the input files. The structure contains the <i>name</i> of
   the input file and the <i>contents</i> in Base64 encoded binary form.
   The operation blocks until the remote execution is complete, and returns
   job outputs (as described above) as the response. This operation may
   only be appropriate for jobs that are not long running.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>The source distribution can be used to install both the server and the
client sides on Unix and Windows platforms. The prerequisites for the
client and server installations are as follows.

<h3>Client</h3>

<ul>
   <li>Java 1.5.x or higher: Download and install J2SE from <a
   href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads">http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads</a>,
   if you don't have it installed already. Add the Java bin directory to
   the environment variable PATH. Also set the environment variable
   JAVA_HOME to point to the top level directory of the JDK
   installation.</li>

   <br>
   <li>Ant 1.6.1 or higher: Ant is a make-like utility for compiling Java
   programs. Install Ant from <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">
   http://ant.apache.org</a>. Set the environment variable <i>ANT_HOME</i>
   to point to your Ant installation.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Server</h3>

<p>Apart from the above packages required for the client, the server also
requires the following packages:

<ul>
   <li>Axis 1.2.1: Axis is a SOAP and Web services toolkit for Java.
   Install the binary or source version of Axis 1.2.1 from <a
   href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">http://ws.apache.org/axis/</a>.
   Alternatively, you could also download a <a
   href="http://nbcr.net/services/downloads/axis-src-1_2_1.tar.gz">cached
   version</a>. Henceforth, we will refer to the location of Axis
   installation as <i>AXIS_HOME</i>.</li>

   <br>
   <li>Tomcat 5.0.30: Tomcat is a servlet container than can be used to
   host our Web service implementation. Install the binary version of
   Tomcat 5.0.30 from <a href= "http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">
   http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/</a>. A <a
   href="http://nbcr.net/services/downloads/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.30.tar.gz">cached
   version</a> may also be downloaded alternatively. Henceforth, we will
   refer to the location of the Tomcat installation as
   <i>CATALINA_HOME</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following packages are optional:
<ul>
   <li>MPI: If you plan to run your application in parallel, you will need
   a version of MPI. You will also need to make sure that your SSH keys are
   set up to be able to run MPI jobs without prompting for a password.</li>

   <br>
   <li>Postgres 7.4.6 (or higher): If you plan to persist the state of the
   service in a database, you will need to install Postgres from <a
   href="http://www.postgresql.org/">http://www.postgresql.org/</a>.</li>

   <br>
   <li>Scheduler Tools: One way to enable access to schedulers is via the
   <a href="http://www.globus.org">Globus Toolkit</a>. The primary
   requirement is that clients must be able to launch jobs on your resource
   using GRAM via the Globus gatekeeper. In addition, jobmanager plugins
   must be available for the particular scheduler that you have installed.
   In other words, GRAM clients must be able to submit jobs to your
   scheduler via the Globus gatekeeper. We have used Globus version 3.2.1
   for our development and testing, but you may use any other version as
   long as the above requirements are met.

   <p>We have used <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor">Condor</a> for
   serial jobs only, and <a href="http://gridengine.sunsource.net/">SGE</a>
   for serial as well as parallel jobs. Globus jobmanager plugins are
   available for both of the above, and must be installed if you plan to
   use either of them.

   <p>Another alternative to access schedulers is via the <a
   href="http://drmaa.org/">DRMAA</a> API. The Web services can submit jobs
   to schedulers as long as they support the DRMAA API. We have only tested
   job submits to SGE via DRMAA.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Download the source distribution for installation from <a
href="http://nbcr.net/services/#Software">here</a>, if you don't have the
appropriate version already.

<p>Extract the downloaded tarball using the GNU tar utility (or other
similar utilities for Windows), as follows:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    tar zxvf opal-ws-1.5.1.tar.gz
</pre>
</font>

<p>This should create a new directory called opal-ws-1.5.1/ where
all the sources are expanded. Henceforth, we refer to this directory as
<i>OPAL_HOME</i>.

<h3>Server</h3>

<p>1. Install Axis inside Tomcat by copying over the
$AXIS_HOME/webapps/axis directory to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps. On Windows,
you can use Windows Explorer to do the same, while on Unix you can execute
the following command:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    cp -r $AXIS_HOME/webapps/axis $CATALINA_HOME/webapps
</pre>
</font>

<p>2. Edit $OPAL_HOME/etc/opal.properties to configure the static container
properties correctly. It should look something like the following:

<font color="green">
<pre>
    # the base URL for the tomcat installation 
    # this is required since Java can't figure out the IP 
    # address if there are multiple network interfaces
    tomcat.url=http://localhost:8080

    # parallel parameters
    num.procs=1
    mpi.run=/Users/sriramkrishnan/Misc/mpich-1.2.7/bin/mpirun

    # location of working directory relative to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps.
    # this could be a symbolic link to another location (which should be
    # NFS mounted if this is on a cluster). if this is a symlink, copy
    # etc/opal.xml to $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/opal.xml. if
    # the name of the symlink is changed to something other than "opal", 
    # modify the opal.xml accordingly
    # working.dir=opal

    # database information
    database.use=false
    database.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/app_db
    database.user=app_user
    database.passwd=app_passwd

    # drmma information
    drmaa.use=false
    drmaa.pe=mpich

    # globus information
    globus.use=false
    globus.gatekeeper=localhost:2119/jobmanager-sge
    globus.service_cert=/Users/sriramkrishnan/certs/app_service.cert.pem
    globus.service_privkey=/Users/sriramkrishnan/certs/app_service.privkey
</pre>
</font>

<p>Set the <tt>tomcat.url</tt> to the correct
<tt>http://ip-address:port</tt> of the server. If the service will wrap a
parallel application, set the <tt>num.procs</tt> to the number of
processors available, and the <tt>mpi.run</tt> to the location of the
mpirun on your host. 

<p>By default, all new working directories for job executions are created
inside the $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT directory. You may wish to change
this to another location on your system (which should be NFS mounted, if
you are installing on a cluster). If you would like to do so for any
reason, uncomment the property <tt>working.dir</tt>. Then run the following
commands:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    cp $OPAL_HOME/etc/opal.xml $CATALINA_HOME/conf/Catalina/localhost/ 
    cd $CATALINA_HOME/webapps 
    ln -s /path/to/working_dir/on/nfs opal
</pre>
</font>

<p>Note that the above use of symbolic links will only work on Unix
systems. 

<p>If you wish to install a database to persist service state, please refer
to <a href="./database.html">database.html</a>. If you would like to set up
scheduler support, refer to <a href="./scheduler.html">scheduler.html</a>.
You can also optionally set up secure access to your services by consulting
<a href="./security.html">security.html</a>.

<p>3. Edit the $OPAL_HOME/build-opal.properties file to ensure that the build
properties are set correctly. Set <tt>catalina.home</tt> to point to the
location of your Tomcat installation (i.e. $CATALINA_HOME),
<tt>axis.webapp</tt> to the name used by the Axis web application
(typically, it is just <i>axis</i>), and <tt>tomcat.port</tt> to the port
number that the Tomcat server is running on.

<p>4. Install the Opal jars into the Axis webapp, by executing the
following command:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    ant -f build-opal.xml install
</pre>
</font>

<p>5. Run the Tomcat server by changing to the $CATALINA_HOME/bin directory,
and running the appropriate command (bat on Windows, sh on Unix):
<font color="green">
<pre>
    ./startup.bat|sh
</pre>
</font>

<p>6. Validate that Axis has been deployed correctly by clicking on <a
href="http://localhost:8080/axis/happyaxis.jsp">
http://localhost:8080/axis/happyaxis.jsp</a>. If you have deployed Tomcat
on another port, you will have to change the port number above. If all the
<b>Needed Components</b> are found, Axis has been deployed fine. You can
ignore the warnings about the <b>Optional Components</b>.
 
<p>7. Create a configuration file for your application. For example, you
can download the <a href="http://openbabel.sourceforge.net/">Babel</a>
program, which is designed to support molecular modeling, chemistry, and
many related areas, including interconversion of file formats and data. A
sample configuration file for the same, located in
$OPAL_HOME/etc/babel_config.xml, is shown below.
<font color="green">
<pre>
&lt;appConfig xmlns="http://nbcr.sdsc.edu/opal/types"
           xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"&gt;
  &lt;metadata&gt;
    &lt;usage&gt;&lt;![CDATA[./babel [-i&lt;input-type&gt;] &lt;name&gt; [-o&lt;output-type&gt;] &lt;name&gt;]]&gt;&lt;/usage&gt;
    &lt;info xsd:type="xsd:string"&gt;
    &lt;![CDATA[
    ...
    Currently supported input types
	alc -- Alchemy file
	prep -- Amber PREP file
	...
    Currently supported output types
    ...
	caccrt -- Cacao Cartesian file
	cacint -- Cacao Internal file
    ...
    Additional options : 
    ...
    ]]&gt;
    &lt;/info&gt;
  &lt;/metadata&gt;
  &lt;binaryLocation&gt;/Users/sriramkrishnan/bin/babel&lt;/binaryLocation&gt;
  &lt;defaultArgs&gt;&lt;/defaultArgs&gt;
  &lt;parallel&gt;false&lt;/parallel&gt;
&lt;/appConfig&gt;
</pre>
</font>

<p>The configuration consists of a top level element <i>appConfig</i>,
which contains <i>metadata</i>, <i>binaryLocation</i>, <i>defaultArgs</i>,
and <i>parallel</i> elements. The metadata consists of <i>usage</i>, which
is a string specifying how the application is to be invoked, and an array
of optional application information specified as <i>info</i> elements. In
the above file, the various options that can be used with the application
are specified within the metadata. The binaryLocation specifies the
location of the application binary - note that this has to be the location
of a <i>single</i> executable. No arguments may be specified here. However,
default arguments that need to be used for every run can be specified
inside the defaultArgs element. The parallel element specifies if an
application is parallel or not. Use the babel_config.xml as a guideline to
write configurations for your particular applications.

<p>8. Deploy the services inside Tomcat, by changing to the $OPAL_HOME
directory, and running the following command:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    $ANT_HOME/bin/ant -f build-opal.xml deploy -DserviceName=&lt;serviceName&gt; -DappConfig=&lt;appConfig&gt;
</pre>
</font>

<p>For example, to deploy the Babel service, you would type the following
command:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    $ANT_HOME/bin/ant -f build-opal.xml deploy -DserviceName=BabelServicePort -DappConfig=etc/babel_config.xml
</pre>
</font>

<p>Note that you can undeploy your service at any time by running the 
following command:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    $ANT_HOME/bin/ant -f build-opal.xml undeploy -DserviceName=&lt;serviceName&gt;
</pre>
</font>

<p>If you plan on using the service with large inputs and outputs, it is a
good idea to increase the heap size being used by the JVM. This can be done
by setting the <i>JAVA_OPTS</i> environment variable to <i>-Xmx1024m</i>,
and restarting Tomcat. This increases the heap size to 1GB. If all went
well until this step, the services are running and ready to be used. Test
them by running the client, described in the following section.

<p>The service creates new working directories for every execution. These
working directories are not deleted automatically, so they must be
periodically cleaned up. You may use the script
$OPAL_HOME/etc/cleanup.sh to do so - you will have to modify it to point
to your Tomcat installation (and optionally modify the number of days to
retain scratch directories).

<h3>Client</h3>

<p>A generic Java client is implemented by 
$OPAL_HOME/src/edu/sdsc/nbcr/opal/GenericServiceClient.java. It lets you
run any application exposed as an Opal service, and retrieve its
status and outputs.

<p>To compile the client, perform the following step from inside
the $OPAL_HOME directory.
<font color="green">
<pre>
    $ANT_HOME/bin/ant -f build-opal.xml jar
</pre>
</font>

<p>Before running the client, set your classpath using the
classpath.bat|(c)sh script depending on the OS/shell you use - e.g. if you
use tcsh on Unix, set your classpath by typing the following command:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    source classpath.csh
</pre>
</font>

<p>To launch a job using the Babel service which was described above, you could use the
following command, which displays the resulting job id, along with the preliminary status.
<font color="green">
<pre>
    java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient -l http://localhost:8080/axis/services/BabelServicePort 
	                                         -r launchJob 
						 -a "-ipdb sample.pdb -h -opdb output.pdb" 
						 -f etc/sample.pdb
</pre>
</font>

<p>You can retrieve job status by running the following command:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient -l http://localhost:8080/axis/services/BabelServicePort 
	                                         -r queryStatus
						 -j &lt;job_id&gt;
</pre>
</font>

<p>Once the job has finished executing, you can also retrieve output metadata using:
<font color="green">
<pre>
    java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient -l http://localhost:8080/axis/services/BabelServicePort 
	                                         -r getOutputs
						 -j &lt;job_id&gt;
</pre>
</font>

<p>You may need to change the above URL if you used a different port, or are
running the client from another machine. Note that you can get the complete
usage information for the client by using the following command:
<font color="green">
<pre>
   java edu.sdsc.nbcr.opal.GenericServiceClient
</pre>
</font>
