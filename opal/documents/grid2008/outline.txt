Title:

On Supporting Molecular Visualization on Grid Resources using Visual
Programming Environments

Outline:

1) Intro on scientific workflows (MS) and grid computing (SK)

2) Vision vs other workflow management systems (MS, except section 2.c)
	a. Design -- workflow representation and control
	b. API -- how to write Vision nodes, introspection, etc
	c. Comparison with other tools (LC)
	   i)  Kepler, Ptolemy and MoML
	   ii) Taverna, Scufl and Freeflou

3) Application based services (SK)
	a. Opal wrapper and GUI
	b. Opal and Opal-CSF4
	c. Data services

4) Service based workflows
	a. Vision based grid workflows (MS, GV, SD)
	b. Virtualization of Opal services (SD - could you write something about how you automatically create Vision nodes from the service list)
	c. Virtualization of Vision based workflows
	   i) Use a local CLI opal client to access local or remote services (SK)
	   ii) Automatic vision node creation through the opal client information service (SK, GV - how the generated class is converted into a Vision node using introspection)

5) Discussion - Workflow modeling and execution
	a. How vision currently stores workflow (MS)
	b. Fault tolerance (MS, SK)
	c. Support for XPDL and other representations for workflows (LC)

6) Conclusions (SK)
